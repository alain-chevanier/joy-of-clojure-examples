* Functions
** How to define
We can define an anonymous functions as follows:

#+begin_src clojure
(fn [x] (* x x))
#+end_src

But if we want to use it somewhere we need to give it a name with the special form ~def~ as follows:

#+begin_src clojure
(def square
  (fn [x] (* x x)))
#+end_src

We can also use a shorter version to define a function using the macro ~defn~ as follows:

#+begin_src clojure
(defn square
  "Doc String for square func, use it to document what the function does"
  [x]
  (println "Calculating the square of x: " x)
  (* x x))
#+end_src

** Multi-arity functions
To create a functions with a variable number of arguments we may use the following syntax

#+begin_src clojure
(defn make-set
  ([x] #{x})
  ([x y] #{x y})
  ([x y & zs] (clojure.set/union #{x y} (apply make-set zs))))
#+end_src
